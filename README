File blacklist.txt holds network ranges of known unsecure networks.
Hash char # is used for comments.

To create and fill iptables chain use shell script like:

iptables -N blacklist 2>/dev/null
iptables -F blacklist
for net in `egrep -v '^(#|$)' blacklist.txt`;
  do iptables -A blacklist -s $net;
  do iptables -A blacklist -d $net;
done


Now with blacklist chain filled add jump to blacklist where appropriate
iptables -A INPUT -j blacklist
iptables -A OUTPUT -j blacklist
